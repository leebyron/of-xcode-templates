The specific awesomeness of these templates, is that it allows you to create your project wherever you like, rather than requiring it be within the openFrameworks/apps/ subdirectory.

To install:
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Project\ Templates
git clone git@github.com:leebyron/of-xcode-templates.git openFrameworks

Be sure to right-click and "Get Info" on the the blue project icon in XCode and change the "OF" variable to the location of your openFrameworks directory.
